📘 Practice Project — Hybrid Project Management using Jira & Microsoft Project
🧩 Overview

This project demonstrates a hybrid project management approach by integrating Agile (Jira) and Waterfall (Microsoft Project) methodologies. The goal was to effectively plan, track, and deliver a mock software project while maintaining transparency, accountability, and predictable delivery timelines.

The project focuses on building practical experience in end-to-end project lifecycle management — from requirement planning and resource allocation to sprint execution, tracking, and stakeholder reporting.

🎯 Objectives

To plan, monitor, and execute a software development lifecycle using both Agile and Traditional (Waterfall) approaches.

To utilize Jira for sprint management, backlog creation, and real-time progress tracking.

To design a comprehensive project plan in Microsoft Project (.mpp) including tasks, dependencies, milestones, and Gantt charts.

To improve team coordination, delivery accuracy, and visibility for all stakeholders through data-driven tracking and dashboards.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Jira Software – For Agile sprint planning, task tracking, and burndown charts.

Microsoft Project (MSP) – For timeline scheduling, resource allocation, and dependency mapping.

Agile Methodologies – Scrum, Sprint Planning, Backlog Grooming.

Project Management Metrics – Gantt Charts, Burndown Reports, Velocity Tracking.
